// A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

// He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

// His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

// How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

// Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
// Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
// Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
// Float parameter "window" must be less than h.

function bouncingBall(h,  bounce,  window) {
  if(bounce >= 1 || bounce <= 0) return -1;
  let pass = 0;
  while(h > window){
    pass++;
    h = h * bounce;
    if(h > window) pass++;
  }
  return pass > 0 ? pass : -1;
