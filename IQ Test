// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the 
// others.Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that 
// among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

function iqTest(numbers){
  numbers = numbers.split(' ');
  let oddCount = 0, evenCount = 0, oddIndex = 0, evenIndex = 0;
  
  for(let i = 0, l = numbers.length; i < l; i++) {
    if(numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
      evenCount++;
      evenIndex = i;
    } else if(numbers[i] % 2 !== 0) {
