// An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one in which there is a constant difference between the consecutive terms of a given series of 
// numbers. You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There is however one hitch: exactly one term from 
// the original series is missing from the set of numbers which have been given to you. The rest of the given series is the same as the 
// original AP. Find the missing term.

// You have to write a function that receives a list, list size will always be at least 3 numbers. The missing term will never be the 
// first or last one.

var findMissing = function (list) {

  var empty = [];
  for(var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    empty.push(list[i+1] - list[i]);
  }
  
  empty.sort((a,b) => {return a - b});
  
  for(var i = 0; i < list.length-1; i++) {
    if(list[i+1] > 0) {
      if(list[i+1]-list[i] !== empty[0]){
        return list[i] + empty[0];
      }
    }
    else if (list[i+1] < 0) {
      if(list[i+1]-list[i] !== empty[1]){
        return list[i] + empty[1];
      }
